@par Example Description 


How to use the CRYPTO peripheral to encrypt/decrypt data(Plaintext/Ciphertext) in
interrupt mode using AES with Combined Cipher Machine (CCM) then generate the authentication TAG .

At the beginning of the main program the HAL_Init() function is called to reset 
all the peripherals, initialize the Flash interface and the systick.
The SystemClock_Config() function is used to configure the system clock for STM32F756xx Devices :
The CPU at 216MHz 


The AES-CCM mode requires:
1. Plaintext/Ciphertext: which will be authenticated and encrypted/decrypted. 
   It's size must be a multiple of 4 words. if it's not it must be padded.
    
2. B1 block or Header ( also named associated data): that will be authenticated 
   but not encrypted.

3. B0 block : first block B0 is formatted by Flags, Nonce and the octet length
   of Plaintext.

4. Key: is the parameter which determines the cipher text. In this example the key
   size is 192 bits = 6 words.

CRYP peripheral must be initialized once from the beginning, then for each operation of 
encryption/decryption, only configuration(HAL_CRYP_SetConfig) should be made if needed.
 
The AES-CCM encryption and TAG generation provides :
1. Encryptedtext: which is the encryption result of Plaintext, it is compared to Ciphertext.
2. TAG: the Message Authentication Code generated after the encryption and it's compared
   to ExpectedTAG.

The AES-CCM decryption and TAG generation provides :
1. Decryptedtext: which is the Decryption result of Ciphertext, it is compared to Plaintext.
2. TAG: the Message Authentication Code generated after the encryption and it's compared
   to ExpectedTAG.

 The encryption/decryption is performed in non-blocking mode using the HAL function
 "HAL_CRYP_Encrypt_IT" and "HAL_CRYP_Decrypt_IT". when compute is complete the
 output FIFO transfer completed callbacks set variable  "CrypCompleteDetected" 
 to 1 then result is compared to the expected buffer. 
   
STM32756G-EVAL LEDs are used to monitor the encryption/decryption and TAG generation  status:
 - LED1(GREEN) is ON when encryption/decryption and TAG generation is right.
 - LED3(RED) is ON when encryption or decryption or TAG generation is wrong.
 
@note Care must be taken when using HAL_Delay(), this function provides accurate delay (in milliseconds)
      based on variable incremented in SysTick ISR. This implies that if HAL_Delay() is called from
      a peripheral ISR process, then the SysTick interrupt must have higher priority (numerically lower)
      than the peripheral interrupt. Otherwise the caller ISR process will be blocked.
      To change the SysTick interrupt priority you have to use HAL_NVIC_SetPriority() function.
      
@note The application needs to ensure that the SysTick time base is always set to 1 millisecond
      to have correct HAL operation.

@Note If the user code size exceeds the DTCM-RAM size or starts from internal cacheable memories (SRAM1 and SRAM2),that is shared between several processors,
      then it is highly recommended to enable the CPU cache and maintain its coherence at application level.
      The address and the size of cacheable buffers (shared between CPU and other masters)  must be properly updated to be aligned to cache line size (32 bytes).

@Note It is recommended to enable the cache and maintain its coherence, but depending on the use case
      It is also possible to configure the MPU as "Write through", to guarantee the write access coherence.
              In that case, the MPU must be configured as Cacheable/Bufferable/Not Shareable.
              Even though the user must manage the cache coherence for read accesses.
              Please refer to the AN4838 “Managing memory protection unit (MPU) in STM32 MCUs”
              Please refer to the AN4839 “Level 1 cache on STM32F7 Series”

@par Hardware and Software environment

  - This example runs on STM32F756xx devices.
  
  - This example has been tested with an STMicroelectronics STM32756G-EVAL board revB
    board and can be easily tailored to any other supported device 
    and development board.

@par How to use it ? 

In order to make the program work, you must do the following:
 - Open your preferred toolchain 
 - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory
 - Run the example
