@par Example Description

  This example provides a description of how to configure DMA2D peripheral in 
  Memory_to_Memory with Pixel Format Conversion and A8 color mode, and display the result on LCD.
  
  The DAM2D source buffer is in A8 format and size 320x240 located in internal SRAM.
  This buffer is filled by the example to provide a transparency index table where each byte represents 
  the transparency of a pixel in the final result image.  
  the A8 source buffer is constructed in a way where values of the image first row are set to transparency = 15
  then increment the transparency for each row which gives a degraded transparency effect.
  
  The DMA2D destination buffer is located in SDRAM with color mode ARGB8888 used as the LCD display frame buffer.

  At the beginning of the main program the HAL_Init() function is called to reset 
  all the peripherals, initialize the Flash interface and the systick.
  Then the SystemClock_Config() function is used to configure the system
  clock (SYSCLK) to run at 200 MHz.
 
  In this basic example the goal is to explain how to use the DMA2D with A8 color format 
  to create a fixed color image with indexed transparency.

  First the LCD_DSI screen is initialized to display the LCD_FRAME_BUFFER using LTDC layer 1.
  
  The A8 transparency index table is then constructed as explained above .
  User can change the example to bypass this stage and use a constant A8 transparency table if available, 
  or change the transparency index table construction to make any transparency effect he desires.   
  
  Then in a while loop :
  
    - The DMA2D is configured to memory to memory with Pixel format conversion.
      Destination color mode is set to ARB8888, source color mode is set to A8 mode (indexed transparency)
      Parameter InputAlpha is set to 0x0000FF00 for a green fixed color.
      Parameter RedBlueSwap is set to DMA2D_RB_REGULAR i.e do not swap Red and blue colors
      And parameter AlphaInverted is set either to DMA2D_REGULAR_ALPHA or DMA2D_INVERTED_ALPHA
      DMA2D_REGULAR_ALPHA : keep the Alpha values given in tha A8 transparency index table.
      DMA2D_INVERTED_ALPHA : invert the  Alpha values given in tha A8 transparency index table before applying it
      example : when DMA2D_INVERTED_ALPHA is used , if alpha = 0x11 for a given pixel 
                then applied value for this pixel is 0xFF - 0x11 = 0xEE
 
   - After the DMA2D configuration , start the transfer. 
     The result , a green 320x240 rectangle with degraded transparency effect is displayed on the LCD.
     Wait for 2 sec, change the DMA2 config (AlphaInverted parameter) then go to the next loop.
  
 => Output offset is the number of pixel to be skipped after each transferred line
                      
 how to calculate the size of the transferred data ? 
 => selected destination color mode gives the number of bits per pixel and we have 
    (ARGB8888 => 32bits/pixel) the number of pixel per line and the number of line, 
    therefore :    
    data_size = (bits per pixel) X (pixel per line + output offset) X (number of line)

 how to calculate the size of the source A8 buffer data ? 
 => As source buffer is in A8 format , each byte represents the transparency for a pixel of the final result buffer. 
    Giving the number of pixel per line and the number of line :    
    A8_data_size (in bytes) = (pixel per line) X (number of line) 
       
STM32F769I-EVAL board's LEDs can be used to monitor the transfer status:
 - LED1 is ON when the DMA2D transfer is complete.
 - LED2 is ON when there is a DMA2D transfer error.
 - LED3 is ON when there is an error in LTDC transfer/Init process.
 
@note Care must be taken when using HAL_Delay(), this function provides accurate delay (in milliseconds)
      based on variable incremented in SysTick ISR. This implies that if HAL_Delay() is called from
      a peripheral ISR process, then the SysTick interrupt must have higher priority (numerically lower)
      than the peripheral interrupt. Otherwise the caller ISR process will be blocked.
      To change the SysTick interrupt priority you have to use HAL_NVIC_SetPriority() function.
      
@note The application need to ensure that the SysTick time base is always set to 1 millisecond
      to have correct HAL operation.

@note The STM32F7xx devices can reach a maximum clock frequency of 216MHz but as this example uses SDRAM,
      the system clock is limited to 200MHz. Indeed proper functioning of the SDRAM is only guaranteed 
      at a maximum system clock frequency of 200MHz.

@Note If the user code size exceeds the DTCM-RAM size or starts from internal cacheable memories (SRAM1 and SRAM2),that is shared between several processors,
      then it is highly recommended to enable the CPU cache and maintain its coherence at application level.
      The address and the size of cacheable buffers (shared between CPU and other masters)  must be properly updated to be aligned to cache line size (32 bytes).

@Note It is recommended to enable the cache and maintain its coherence, but depending on the use case
      It is also possible to configure the MPU as "Write through", to guarantee the write access coherence.
      In that case, the MPU must be configured as Cacheable/Bufferable/Not Shareable.
      Even though the user must manage the cache coherence for read accesses.
      Please refer to the AN4838 “Managing memory protection unit (MPU) in STM32 MCUs”
      Please refer to the AN4839 “Level 1 cache on STM32F7 Series”
