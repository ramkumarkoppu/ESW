@par Example Description

How to configure DMA2D peripheral in Register-to-memory transfer mode and
display the result on the LCD.

  At the beginning of the main program the HAL_Init() function is called to reset 
  all the peripherals, initialize the Flash interface and the systick.
  Then the SystemClock_Config() function is used to configure the system
  clock (SYSCLK) to run at 216 MHz.
 
  The Register_to_Memory transfer mode is used to fill a user defined area by a 
  fixed color. In this example, a green 320x240 rectangle is displayed on the LCD.

  Output offset is the number of pixel to be skipped after each transferred line
                      
  how to calculate the size of the transferred data ? 
  => selected color mode gives the number of bits per pixel and we have 
     (ARGB4444 => 16bits/pixel) the number of pixel per line and the number of line, 
     therefore :
    
     data_size = (bits per pixel) X (pixel per line + output offset) X (number of line) 
       
STM32 Eval board's LEDs can be used to monitor the transfer status:
 - LED1 is ON when the transfer is complete.
 - LED2 is ON when there is a transfer error.
 - LED3 is ON when there is an error in transfer/Init process.

@note Care must be taken when using HAL_Delay(), this function provides accurate delay (in milliseconds)
      based on variable incremented in SysTick ISR. This implies that if HAL_Delay() is called from
      a peripheral ISR process, then the SysTick interrupt must have higher priority (numerically lower)
      than the peripheral interrupt. Otherwise the caller ISR process will be blocked.
      To change the SysTick interrupt priority you have to use HAL_NVIC_SetPriority() function.
      
@note The application needs to ensure that the SysTick time base is always set to 1 millisecond
      to have correct HAL operation.

@Note If the user code size exceeds the DTCM-RAM size or starts from internal cacheable memories (SRAM1 and SRAM2),that is shared between several processors,
      then it is highly recommended to enable the CPU cache and maintain its coherence at application level.
      The address and the size of cacheable buffers (shared between CPU and other masters)  must be properly updated to be aligned to cache line size (32 bytes).

@Note It is recommended to enable the cache and maintain its coherence, but depending on the use case
      It is also possible to configure the MPU as "Write through", to guarantee the write access coherence.
      In that case, the MPU must be configured as Cacheable/Bufferable/Not Shareable.
      Even though the user must manage the cache coherence for read accesses.
      Please refer to the AN4838 “Managing memory protection unit (MPU) in STM32 MCUs”
      Please refer to the AN4839 “Level 1 cache on STM32F7 Series”

@par Hardware and Software environment  

  - This example runs on STM32F767xx/STM32F769xx/STM32F777xx/STM32F779xx devices.
  
  - This example has been tested with STMicroelectronics STM32F769I-EVAL board and can
    be easily tailored to any other supported device and development board.
                

@par How to use it ?

In order to make the program work, you must do the following :
 - Open your preferred toolchain 
 - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory
 - Run the example
