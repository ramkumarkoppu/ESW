@par Example Description 

This example provides a description of how to use the different BSP drivers. 

At the beginning of the main program the HAL_Init() function is called to reset 
all the peripherals, initialize the Flash interface and the systick.
Then the SystemClock_Config() function is used to configure the system
clock (SYSCLK) to run at 200 MHz.

This example shows how to use the different functionalities of components 
available on the board by switching between all tests using key button. 

 ** Push the User button to start first Test.  
Green Led (LD1) will blink between each test.Press user key to start another test:

 ** JOYSTICK **
Use the joystick button to move a pointer inside a rectangle 
(up/down/right/left) and change the pointer color(select).

 ** Touchscreen **
Use touchscreen functionality to select or activate colored circle inside a rectangle.
A calibration is needed when using MB1046.

 ** LCD **
This example shows how to use the different LCD features to display string
with different fonts, to display different shapes and to draw a bitmap.

 ** SD **
This example shows how to erase, write and read the SD card and also 
how to detect the presence of the card.

 ** EEPROM **
This example show how to read and write data in EEPROM I2C M24LR64 connected on STM327x6G-EVAL revB
   * The I2C RF EEPROM memory (M24LR64) is available through the connector CN2

 ** NOR **
This example shows how to erase, write and read the NOR memory.

 ** SRAM **
This example shows how to erase, write and read the SRAM memory.

 ** SDRAM **
This example shows how to erase, write and read the SDRAM memory.

 ** LCD LOG **
This example show how to use the LCD log features. 

@note The STM32F7xx devices can reach a maximum clock frequency of 216MHz but as this example uses SDRAM,
      the system clock is limited to 200MHz. Indeed proper functioning of the SDRAM is only guaranteed 
      at a maximum system clock frequency of 200MHz.

@Note If the user code size exceeds the DTCM-RAM size or starts from internal cacheable memories (SRAM1 and SRAM2),that is shared between several processors,
      then it is highly recommended to enable the CPU cache and maintain its coherence at application level.
      The address and the size of cacheable buffers (shared between CPU and other masters)  must be properly updated to be aligned to cache line size (32 bytes).

@Note It is recommended to enable the cache and maintain its coherence, but depending on the use case
      It is also possible to configure the MPU as "Write through", to guarantee the write access coherence.
      In that case, the MPU must be configured as Cacheable/Bufferable/Not Shareable.
      Even though the user must manage the cache coherence for read accesses.
      Please refer to the AN4838 “Managing memory protection unit (MPU) in STM32 MCUs”
      Please refer to the AN4839 “Level 1 cache on STM32F7 Series”

@par Hardware and Software environment  

  - This example runs on STM32F756xx/STM32F746xx devices.
    
  - This example has been tested with STMicroelectronics STM327x6G-EVAL revB
    evaluation boards and can be easily tailored to any other supported device 
    and development board.
  
@par How to use it ? 

In order to make the program work, you must do the following :
 - Open your preferred toolchain 
 - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory
 - Run the example
