@par Application Description

How to use mutexes with CMSIS RTOS API.

This example creates three threads, with different priorities, that access the 
same mutex, as described below:

MutexHighPriorityThread() has the highest priority so executes 
first and grabs the mutex and sleeps for a short period to let the lower 
priority threads execute.  When it has completed its demo functionality
it gives the mutex back before suspending itself. 
At that point, LED1 toggles.
 
MutexMediumPriorityThread() attempts to access the mutex by performing
a blocking 'wait'.  This thread blocks when the mutex is already taken 
by the high priority thread. It does not unblock until the highest 
priority thread  has released the mutex, and it does not actually run until 
the highest priority thread has suspended itself.
When it eventually does obtain the mutex all it does is give the mutex back
prior to also suspending itself.
At this point both the high and medium priority threads are suspended and LED2 toggles.

MutexLowPriorityThread() runs at the idle priority.  It spins round
a tight loop attempting to obtain the mutex with a non-blocking call.  As
the lowest priority thread it will not successfully obtain the mutex until
both high and medium priority threads are suspended.  Once it eventually 
does obtains the mutex, it first resumes both suspended threads prior to giving the mutex back,
resulting in the low priority thread temporarily inheriting the highest thread priority.

Add the following variables to LiveWatch, these variables must remain equals all the time:
- HighPriorityThreadCycles
- MediumPriorityThreadCycles
- LowPriorityThreadCycles

STM32 NUCLEO board's LEDs can be used to monitor the application status:
- LED1, LED2 should toggle when the application runs successfully.
- LED3 toggles when any error occurs.

@note Care must be taken when using HAL_Delay(), this function provides accurate
      delay (in milliseconds) based on variable incremented in HAL time base ISR.
      This implies that if HAL_Delay() is called from a peripheral ISR process, then
      the HAL time base interrupt must have higher priority (numerically lower) than
      the peripheral interrupt. Otherwise the caller ISR process will be blocked.
      To change the HAL time base interrupt priority you have to use HAL_NVIC_SetPriority()
      function.
 
@note The application needs to ensure that the HAL time base is always set to 1 millisecond
      to have correct HAL operation.

@note The FreeRTOS heap size configTOTAL_HEAP_SIZE defined in FreeRTOSConfig.h is set accordingly to the 
      OS resources memory requirements of the application with +10% margin and rounded to the upper Kbyte boundary.

on STM32Cube with RTOS".

@Note If the user code size exceeds the DTCM-RAM size or starts from internal cacheable memories (SRAM1 and SRAM2),that is shared between several processors,
      then it is highly recommended to enable the CPU cache and maintain its coherence at application level.
      The address and the size of cacheable buffers (shared between CPU and other masters)  must be properly updated to be aligned to cache line size (32 bytes).

@Note It is recommended to enable the cache and maintain its coherence, but depending on the use case
      It is also possible to configure the MPU as "Write through", to guarantee the write access coherence.
      In that case, the MPU must be configured as Cacheable/Bufferable/Not Shareable.
      Even though the user must manage the cache coherence for read accesses.
      Please refer to the AN4838 “Managing memory protection unit (MPU) in STM32 MCUs”
      Please refer to the AN4839 “Level 1 cache on STM32F7 Series”

@par Hardware and Software environment

  - This example runs on STM32F722xx/STM32F723xx/STM32F732xx/STM32F733xx devices.
    
  - This example has been tested with STM32F722ZE-Nucleo board and can be
    easily tailored to any other supported device and development board.
    

@par How to use it ?

In order to make the program work, you must do the following:
 - Open your preferred toolchain 
 - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory
 - Run the example
