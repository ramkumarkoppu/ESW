@par Example Description

  How to configure the LTDC peripheral to display two layers at the same time.
  The goal of this example is to explain how to blend two layers and how to display 
  an image with L8 (8bits per pixels indexed) as pixel format. 

  In this example, the code is executed from QSPI external memory while data are in internal
  SRAM memory.

  At the beginning of the main program the HAL_Init() function is called to reset 
  all the peripherals, initialize the Flash interface and the systick.
  Then the SystemClock_Config() function is used to configure the system
  clock (SYSCLK) to run at 216 MHz.
 
  After LCD initialization, the LCD layer 1 and Layer 2 are configured as follows :
  - Layer 1 is configured to display an image loaded from flash memory with direct
    color (RGB565) as pixel format and 320x240 (QVGA) size.
  - Layer 2 is configured to display an image loaded from flash memory with indirect
    color (L8) as pixel format and 320x240 (QVGA) size.
    To display an image with an indirect color as pixel format, a color lookup table (CLUT) 
    is loaded, then every byte from image data (L8_320x240) is considered as 
    a position in color lookup table (CLUT).(see example below)  

  The blending is always active and the two layers can be blended following 
  the configured blending factors and the constant alpha.
  In this example the constant alpha for layer 2 is decreased to see the layer 1
  in the intersection zone.

  Example :
  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  |Image data   |  position   CLUT(RGB Value)  |   Alpha  | Output (ARGB value)|
  |-------------|------------------------------|----------|------------------- |
  |00 10 FF 25  |  0   -----> 0xFD10EA         | 0xFF     | 0xFFFD10EA         |
  |             |  .                           |          | 0xFF1548AD         |
  |             |  .                           |          | 0xFFAE6547         |
  |             |  .                           |          | 0xFFDA14EA         |
  |             |  .                           |          | .                  |
  |             |  16  -----> 0x1548AD         |          | .                  |
  |             |  .                           |          | .                  |
  |             |  .                           |          | .                  |
  |             |  37  -----> 0xDA14EA         |          | .                  |
  |             |  .                           |          |                    |
  |             |  .                           |          |                    |
  |             |  255 -----> 0xAE6547         |          |                    |

  The images swap their positions across the LCD in an infinite loop.

STM32 Discovery board's LED can be used to monitor the transfer status:
 - LED1 is ON when there is an error in Init process.

@note Care must be taken when using HAL_Delay(), this function provides accurate delay (in milliseconds)
      based on variable incremented in SysTick ISR. This implies that if HAL_Delay() is called from
      a peripheral ISR process, then the SysTick interrupt must have higher priority (numerically lower)
      than the peripheral interrupt. Otherwise the caller ISR process will be blocked.
      To change the SysTick interrupt priority you have to use HAL_NVIC_SetPriority() function.
      
@note The application need to ensure that the SysTick time base is always set to 1 millisecond
      to have correct HAL operation.

@Note If the user code size exceeds the DTCM-RAM size or starts from internal cacheable memories (SRAM1 and SRAM2),that is shared between several processors,
      then it is highly recommended to enable the CPU cache and maintain its coherence at application level.
      The address and the size of cacheable buffers (shared between CPU and other masters)  must be properly updated to be aligned to cache line size (32 bytes).

@Note It is recommended to enable the cache and maintain its coherence, but depending on the use case
      It is also possible to configure the MPU as "Write through", to guarantee the write access coherence.
      In that case, the MPU must be configured as Cacheable/Bufferable/Not Shareable.
      Even though the user must manage the cache coherence for read accesses.
      Please refer to the AN4838 “Managing memory protection unit (MPU) in STM32 MCUs”
      Please refer to the AN4839 “Level 1 cache on STM32F7 Series”
