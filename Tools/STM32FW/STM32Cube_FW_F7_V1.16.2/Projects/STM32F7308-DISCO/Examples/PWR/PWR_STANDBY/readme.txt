@par Example Description

How to enter the Standby mode and wake-up from this mode by using an external
reset or the wakeup pin.

This projects is configured for STM32F730xx devices using STM32CubeF7 HAL and running on
STM32F7308-DISCO board from STMicroelectronics.

In this example, the code is executed from QSPI external memory while data are in internal
SRAM memory.

In the associated software, the system clock is set to 216 MHz and the SysTick is
programmed to generate an interrupt each 1 ms.
The Low Speed Internal (LSI) clock is used as RTC clock source by default.
EXTI_Line20 is internally connected to the RTC Wakeup event.

The system automatically enters STANDBY mode 3 sec. after start-up. The wake-up pin
is configured before enter low-power mode.

After wake-up from STANDBY mode, program execution restarts in the same way as after
a software RESET.

Two leds LED5 and LED6 are used to monitor the system state as following:
 - LED5 ON  : configuration failed (system will go to an infinite loop)
 - LED6 ON  : system in RUN mode
 - LED6 OFF : system in STANDBY mode

These steps are repeated in an infinite loop.

@note This example can not be used in DEBUG mode due to the fact
      that the Cortex-M7 core is no longer clocked during low power mode
       so debugging features are disabled.

@note Care must be taken when using HAL_Delay(), this function provides accurate delay (in milliseconds)
      based on variable incremented in SysTick ISR. This implies that if HAL_Delay() is called from
      a peripheral ISR process, then the SysTick interrupt must have higher priority (numerically lower)
      than the peripheral interrupt. Otherwise the caller ISR process will be blocked.
      To change the SysTick interrupt priority you have to use HAL_NVIC_SetPriority() function.

@note The application needs to ensure that the SysTick time base is always set to 1 millisecond
      to have correct HAL operation.

@Note If the user code size exceeds the DTCM-RAM size or starts from internal cacheable memories (SRAM1 and SRAM2),that is shared between several processors,
      then it is highly recommended to enable the CPU cache and maintain its coherence at application level.
      The address and the size of cacheable buffers (shared between CPU and other masters)  must be properly updated to be aligned to cache line size (32 bytes).

@Note It is recommended to enable the cache and maintain its coherence, but depending on the use case
      It is also possible to configure the MPU as "Write through", to guarantee the write access coherence.
      In that case, the MPU must be configured as Cacheable/Bufferable/Not Shareable.
      Even though the user must manage the cache coherence for read accesses.
      Please refer to the AN4838 “Managing memory protection unit (MPU) in STM32 MCUs”
      Please refer to the AN4839 “Level 1 cache on STM32F7 Series”

@par Hardware and Software environment

  - This example runs on STM32F730xx devices.

  - This example has been tested with STMicroelectronics STM32F7308 Discovery
    boards and can be easily tailored to any other supported device
    and development board.


@par How to use it ?

In order to make the program work, you must do the following:

  1. Select required configuration in memory.h in Templates\ExtMem_Boot\Incn.
  2. Program the internal Flash with the ExtMem_Boot (see below).
  3. Use corresponding project configuration for this example.
  4. Program the external QSPI memory with this example (see below).
  5. Start debugging user application or reset for free running.

In order to load the ExtMem_Boot code :
   - Open your preferred toolchain :
      - Open the Project
      - Rebuild all files
      - Load project image

In order to load this example to the external memory:
   - Open your preferred toolchain
      - Open the Project
      - Use project matching ExtMem_Boot selected configuration
      - Rebuild all files:
      - Run & debug the program:
      - For an XiP configuration (eXecute in Place from QSPI):
          - Using EWARM or MDK-ARM : Load project image from the IDE: Project->Debug
          - Using SW4STM32 :
            - Open the STM32CubeProgrammer tool
            - Select the QSPI external flash loader "MX25L512G_STM32F7308-DISCO"
            - From Erasing & Programming menu, browse and open the output binary file relative to this example
            - Load the file into the external QSPI flash using "Start Programming" at the address APPLICATION_ADDRESS (0x90000000)
