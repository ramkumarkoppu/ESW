@par Application Description

This directory contains a set of source files that implement thread delaying using 
osDelayUntil function.

This application provide different configuration with linker files which allows different eXecution schemas
Supported configuration by STM32F7508-DISCO:
  - XiP From QSPI, Data on Internal SRAM
  - XiP From QSPI, Data on External SDRAM
  - BootROM : Execution From External SDRAM , Data on Internal SRAM
 
This application creates a thread that waits for 200ms starting from a reference absolute time "PreviousWakeTime"
using osDelayUntil then toggle LED1.

the result is that the thread execution frequency is ensured to be every 200ms 
independently from the time that the thread treatment takes

osDelayUntil function differs from osDelay() in one important aspect:  osDelay () will
cause a thread to block for the specified time in ms from the time osDelay () is
called.  It is therefore difficult to use osDelay () by itself to generate a fixed
execution frequency as the time between a thread starting to execute and that thread
calling osDelay () may not be fixed [the thread may take a different path though the
code between calls, or may get interrupted or preempted a different number of times
each time it executes].

Whereas osDelay () specifies a wake time relative to the time at which the function
is called, osDelayUntil () specifies the absolute (exact) time at which it wishes to
unblock.
PreviousWakeTime must be initialised with the current time prior to its first use 
(PreviousWakeTime = osKernelSysTick ) 

LED1 must blink every 200ms   


@note Care must be taken when using HAL_Delay(), this function provides accurate delay (in milliseconds)
      based on variable incremented in HAL time base ISR. This implies that if HAL_Delay() is called from
      a peripheral ISR process, then the HAL time base interrupt must have higher priority (numerically lower)
      than the peripheral interrupt. Otherwise the caller ISR process will be blocked.
      To change the HAL time base interrupt priority you have to use HAL_NVIC_SetPriority() function.
      
@note The application need to ensure that the HAL time base is always set to 1 millisecond
      to have correct HAL operation.
	  
@note The FreeRTOS heap size configTOTAL_HEAP_SIZE defined in FreeRTOSConfig.h is set according to 
      the OS resources memory requirements of the application with +10% margin and rounded to the 
	  upper Kbyte boundary.

on STM32Cube with RTOS".

@Note If the user code size exceeds the DTCM-RAM size or starts from internal cacheable memories (SRAM1 and SRAM2),that is shared between several processors,
      then it is highly recommended to enable the CPU cache and maintain its coherence at application level.
      The address and the size of cacheable buffers (shared between CPU and other masters)  must be properly updated to be aligned to cache line size (32 bytes).

@Note It is recommended to enable the cache and maintain its coherence, but depending on the use case
      It is also possible to configure the MPU as "Write through", to guarantee the write access coherence.
      In that case, the MPU must be configured as Cacheable/Bufferable/Not Shareable.
      Even though the user must manage the cache coherence for read accesses.
      Please refer to the AN4838 “Managing memory protection unit (MPU) in STM32 MCUs”
      Please refer to the AN4839 “Level 1 cache on STM32F7 Series”

@par Hardware and Software environment

  - This application runs on STM32F750xx devices.
    
  - This application has been tested with STM32F7508-DISCO evaluation board and can be
    easily tailored to any other supported device and development board.

  - STM32F7508-DISCO Set-up
    - None

In order to make the program work, you must do the following:

  1. Select required configuration in memory.h in Templates\ExtMem_Boot\Inc.
     The default configuration is: 
     - DATA_AREA set to USE_INTERNAL_SRAM
     - CODE_AREA set to USE_QSPI
  2. Program the internal Flash with the ExtMem_Boot (see below).
  3. Program the external memory with your application (see below).
  4. Start debugging user application or reset for free running.

In order to load the ExtMem_Boot code :
   - Open your preferred toolchain :
      - Open the Project
      - Rebuild all files
      - Load project image

In order to load the application to the external memory:
   - Open your preferred toolchain
      - Open the Project
      - Use project matching ExtMem_Boot selected configuration
      - Rebuild all files:
      - Run & debug the program:
      - For an XiP configuration (eXecute in Place from QSPI):
          - Using EWARM or MDK-ARM : Load project image from the IDE: Project->Debug
          - Using SW4STM32 :
            - Open the STM32CubeProgrammer tool
            - Select the QSPI external flash loader "N25Q128A_STM32F7508-DISCO" in case of XiP from QSPI
            - From Erasing & Programming menu, browse and open the output binary file relative to your application
            - Load the file into the external QSPI flash using "Start Programming" at the address APPLICATION_ADDRESS (0x90000000)

      - For a BootROM configuration (BootROM external SDRAM):
        - If BINARY_AREA is USE_SPI_NOR then use the STM32CubeProgarmmer tool, select QSPI external flash loader "N25Q128A_STM32F7508-DISCO"
          and load the Project.bin (application binary output file) to the QSPI memory at the address 0x90000000
        - If BINARY_AREA is USE_SDCARD then copy the Project.bin to a micro-SD to be plugged on CN3 and reset the board.
        - In order to debug the  external memory application, user shall attach the debugger, and perform a reset
