@par Demo Description

The STM32Cube Demonstration platform comes on top of the STM32CubeTM as a firmware
package that offers a full set of software components based on a modules architecture
allowing re-using them separately in standalone applications. All these modules are
managed by the STM32Cube Demonstration kernel allowing to dynamically adding new
modules and access to common resources (storage, graphical components and widgets,
memory management, Real-Time operating system)

The STM32Cube Demonstration platform is built around the powerful graphical library
STemWin and the FreeRTOS real time operating system and uses almost the whole STM32
capability to offer a large scope of usage based on the STM32Cube HAL BSP and several
middleware components.

@par Demo Description

The STM32 F7 demonstration is running on STM32F723E-DISCO boards RevC. 

  
Below you find an overview of the different offered module in the demonstration:

 + Video player
 --------------
 The video player module provides a video solution based on the STM32F7xx and STemWin
 movie API. It supports playing movie in AVI format.
 
 User may use the *.avi video files (240x200) provided under "Utilities/Media/Video".
 
 + Audio player
 --------------
 The audio player module provides a complete audio solution based on the STM32F7xx and
 delivers a high-quality music experience. It supports playing music in WAV format but may
 be extended to support other compressed formats such as MP3 and WMA audio formats.
 The Module supports background mode feature.
 
  + Audio recorder
 -----------------
 The audio recorder module allows recording audio and playing it back.
 
 + Analog Clock
 ------------
 The analog clock module shows the the time and gives the possibility to set the time.

@par Hardware and Software environment

  - This application runs on STM32F723xx devices.  

  - This example has been tested with STMicroelectronics STM32F723E_DISCO
    boards RevC and can be easily tailored to any other supported device 
    and development board.


@par How to use it ? 

In order to make the program work, you must do the following :
 - Open your preferred toolchain 
 - Rebuild all files
 - Open STM32 ST-Link Utility V4.1.0, click on "External Loader" from the bar menu then check "MX25L512G_STM32F723E-DISCO" box 
 - Connect the STM32F723E-DISCO board to PC with USB cable through CN1
 - Use "STM32CubeDemo_STM32F723E-DISCO_VX.Y.Z.hex" file with STM32 ST-Link Utility to program both internal Flash and external QSPI memory
 - Run the demonstration
 - copy the audio and video files provided under "Utilities/Media/" in the USB disk
 - Plug USB disk on CN19 connector

@Note If the user code size exceeds the DTCM-RAM size or starts from internal cacheable memories (SRAM1 and SRAM2),that is shared between several processors,
      then it is highly recommended to enable the CPU cache and maintain its coherence at application level.
      The address and the size of cacheable buffers (shared between CPU and other masters)  must be properly updated to be aligned to cache line size (32 bytes).

@Note It is recommended to enable the cache and maintain its coherence, but depending on the use case
      It is also possible to configure the MPU as "Write through", to guarantee the write access coherence.
      In that case, the MPU must be configured as Cacheable/Bufferable/Not Shareable.
      Even though the user must manage the cache coherence for read accesses.
      Please refer to the AN4838 Managing memory protection unit (MPU) in STM32 MCUs
      Please refer to the AN4839 Level 1 cache on STM32F7 Series
