@par Example Description

How to configure the QSPI IP in order to have access to external memory just after reset.

This example describes how to execute a part of the code from a QSPI memory. To do this, 
a section is created where the function is stored.

The QSPI is configured in memory-mapped mode before to call main() function and QSPI memory 
is then available after the reset. 

The configuration of the QSPI is done in the file system_stm32f7xx.c file in the 
function SystemInit_ExtMemCtl(). It is called by the function SystemInit(), which
is the first function called by the Reset_Handler.

The code in executed in a forever loop. It is the same code as GPIO_IOToggle example 
with some code mapped in QSPI mode and other in Flash, to show the jump from one 
memory to the other.

LED1 and LED3 toggle in this forever loop.

In this example, HCLK is configured at 216 MHz.

@note Care must be taken when using HAL_Delay(), this function provides accurate delay (in milliseconds)
      based on variable incremented in SysTick ISR. This implies that if HAL_Delay() is called from
      a peripheral ISR process, then the SysTick interrupt must have higher priority (numerically lower)
      than the peripheral interrupt. Otherwise the caller ISR process will be blocked.
      To change the SysTick interrupt priority you have to use HAL_NVIC_SetPriority() function.
      
@note The application need to ensure that the SysTick time base is always set to 1 millisecond
      to have correct HAL operation.

@Note If the user code size exceeds the DTCM-RAM size or starts from internal cacheable memories (SRAM1 and SRAM2),that is shared between several processors,
      then it is highly recommended to enable the CPU cache and maintain its coherence at application level.
      The address and the size of cacheable buffers (shared between CPU and other masters)  must be properly updated to be aligned to cache line size (32 bytes).

@Note It is recommended to enable the cache and maintain its coherence, but depending on the use case
      It is also possible to configure the MPU as "Write through", to guarantee the write access coherence.
      In that case, the MPU must be configured as Cacheable/Bufferable/Not Shareable.
      Even though the user must manage the cache coherence for read accesses.
      Please refer to the AN4838 “Managing memory protection unit (MPU) in STM32 MCUs”
      Please refer to the AN4839 “Level 1 cache on STM32F7 Series”

@par Hardware and Software environment

  - This example runs on STM32F756xx/STM32F746xx devices.
    
  - This example has been tested with STM327x6G-EVAL board revB and can be
    easily tailored to any other supported device and development board.

  - STM327x6G-EVAL Set-up :
    - Board is configured by default to access QSPI memory
    - To use LED1, ensure that JP24 is in position 2-3
    - To use LED3, ensure that JP23 is in position 2-3

  - A specific region for the SRAM memory has been added in the scatter file 
    (STM32F756xx/STM32F746xx_flash.icf for IAR toolchain, 
    STM327x6G-EVAL.sct for Keil toolchain and linker file for SW4STM32)
    
The QSPI external flash loader is not integrated with supported toolchains, it's only supported with STM32
ST-Link Utility.
To load the example, use STM32 ST-Link Utility to program both internal Flash and external QSPI memory:
1- Open STM32 ST-Link Utility, click on "External Loader" from the bar menu then check "MT25QL512A_STM32756G-EVAL" box 
2- Connect the STM327x6G-EVAL board to PC with USB cable.
3- Compile the projcet to generatethe "STM327x6G_EVAL.hex" file under ""Exe" with STM32 ST-Link Utility
   to program both internal Flash and external QSPI memory
   
@par How to use it ? 

In order to make the program work, you must do the following :
 - Open your preferred toolchain
 - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory
 - Run the example
