@par Example Description 

Configuration of the RTC HAL API to demonstrate the timestamp feature.

At the beginning of the main program the HAL_Init() function is called to reset 
all the peripherals, initialize the Flash interface and the systick.
Then the SystemClock_Config() function is used to configure the system
clock (SYSCLK) to run at 216 MHz.

The RTC peripheral configuration is ensured by the HAL_RTC_Init() function.
This later is calling the HAL_RTC_MspInit()function which core is implementing
the configuration of the needed RTC resources according to the used hardware (CLOCK, 
PWR, RTC clock source and BackUp). You may update this function to change RTC configuration.

@note LSI oscillator clock is used as RTC clock source by default.
      The user can use also LSE as RTC clock source. The user uncomment the adequate 
      line on the main.h file.
      @code
        #define RTC_CLOCK_SOURCE_LSI  
        /* #define RTC_CLOCK_SOURCE_LSE */
      @endcode
      LSI oscillator clock is delivered by a 32 kHz RC.
      LSE (when available on board) is delivered by a 32.768 kHz crystal.

HAL_RTCEx_SetTimeStamp_IT()function is then called to initialize the time stamp feature 
with interrupt mode. It configures the time stamp pin to be rising edge and enables
the time stamp detection on time stamp pin.
HAL_RTC_SetTime()and HAL_RTC_SetDate() functions are then called to initialize the 
time and the date.

The associated firmware performs the following:
1. After startup the program configure the RTC (Time date) and enable the feature 
   timeStamp. 

2. When applying a high level on the time stamp pin (PC.13) by pressing the Tamper push-button, 
   a time stamp event is detected and the calendar is saved in the time stamp structures.
   Each time the user presses on the Tamper push-button, the current time and time stamp are updated and displayed 
   on the debugger in aShowTime and aShowTimeStamp variables.
   Each time the user presses on the Tamper push-button, the LED1 toggles.

- LED1 is turned ON/OFF when the timestamp event is produced.
- LED3 is toggling : This indicates that the system generates an error.
       
@note Care must be taken when using HAL_Delay(), this function provides accurate delay (in milliseconds)
      based on variable incremented in SysTick ISR. This implies that if HAL_Delay() is called from
      a peripheral ISR process, then the SysTick interrupt must have higher priority (numerically lower)
      than the peripheral interrupt. Otherwise the caller ISR process will be blocked.
      To change the SysTick interrupt priority you have to use HAL_NVIC_SetPriority() function.
      
@note The application need to ensure that the SysTick time base is always set to 1 millisecond
      to have correct HAL operation.

@Note If the user code size exceeds the DTCM-RAM size or starts from internal cacheable memories (SRAM1 and SRAM2),that is shared between several processors,
      then it is highly recommended to enable the CPU cache and maintain its coherence at application level.
      The address and the size of cacheable buffers (shared between CPU and other masters)  must be properly updated to be aligned to cache line size (32 bytes).

@Note It is recommended to enable the cache and maintain its coherence, but depending on the use case
      It is also possible to configure the MPU as "Write through", to guarantee the write access coherence.
      In that case, the MPU must be configured as Cacheable/Bufferable/Not Shareable.
      Even though the user must manage the cache coherence for read accesses.
      Please refer to the AN4838 “Managing memory protection unit (MPU) in STM32 MCUs”
      Please refer to the AN4839 “Level 1 cache on STM32F7 Series”

@par Hardware and Software environment

  - This example runs on STM32F756xx/STM32F746xx devices.
  - This example has been tested with STMicroelectronics STM327x6G-EVAL revB 
    board and can be easily tailored to any other supported device 
    and development board.

@par How to use it ? 

In order to make the program work, you must do the following :
 - Open your preferred toolchain 
 - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory
 - Run the example
