@par Example Description 

Update of the TIMER channel 1 period and duty cycle 
using the TIMER DMA burst feature.

Every update DMA request, the DMA will do 3 transfers of half words into Timer 
registers beginning from ARR register.
On the DMA update request, 0x0FFF will be transferred into ARR, 0x0000 
will be transferred into RCR, 0x0555 will be transferred into CCR1. 

The TIM2CLK frequency is set to (SystemCoreClock/2), to get TIM2 counter
clock at 21.6 MHz the Prescaler is computed as following:
- Prescaler = (TIM2CLK / TIM2 counter clock) - 1

SystemCoreClock is set to 216 MHz.

The TIM2 Frequency = TIM2 counter clock/(ARR + 1)
                   = 21.6 MHz / 4096 = 5.273 KHz

The TIM2 CCR1 register value is equal to 0x555, so the TIM2 Channel 1 generates a 
PWM signal with a frequency equal to 5.273 KHz and a duty cycle equal to 33.33%:
TIM2 Channel1 duty cycle = (TIM2_CCR1/ TIM2_ARR + 1)* 100 = 33.33%

The PWM waveform can be displayed using an oscilloscope.

@note Care must be taken when using HAL_Delay(), this function provides accurate
      delay (in milliseconds) based on variable incremented in SysTick ISR. This
      implies that if HAL_Delay() is called from a peripheral ISR process, then 
      the SysTick interrupt must have higher priority (numerically lower)
      than the peripheral interrupt. Otherwise the caller ISR process will be blocked.
      To change the SysTick interrupt priority you have to use HAL_NVIC_SetPriority() function.
      
@note The application need to ensure that the SysTick time base is always set to 1 millisecond
      to have correct HAL operation.

@Note If the user code size exceeds the DTCM-RAM size or starts from internal cacheable memories (SRAM1 and SRAM2),that is shared between several processors,
      then it is highly recommended to enable the CPU cache and maintain its coherence at application level.
      The address and the size of cacheable buffers (shared between CPU and other masters)  must be properly updated to be aligned to cache line size (32 bytes).

@Note It is recommended to enable the cache and maintain its coherence, but depending on the use case
      It is also possible to configure the MPU as "Write through", to guarantee the write access coherence.
      In that case, the MPU must be configured as Cacheable/Bufferable/Not Shareable.
      Even though the user must manage the cache coherence for read accesses.
      Please refer to the AN4838 “Managing memory protection unit (MPU) in STM32 MCUs”
      Please refer to the AN4839 “Level 1 cache on STM32F7 Series”

@par Hardware and Software environment

  - This example runs on STM32756xx devices.
  - In this example, the clock is set to 216 MHz.
    
  - This example has been tested with STMicroelectronics STM327x6G-EVAL revB 
    board and can be easily tailored to any other supported device 
    and development board.

  - STM327x6G-EVAL revB Set-up
    - Connect the TIM2 pin to an oscilloscope to monitor the different waveforms: 
      - TIM2 CH1 (PA.00 (pin 15 in CN5 connector))

@par How to use it ? 

In order to make the program work, you must do the following :
 - Open your preferred toolchain 
 - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory
 - Run the example
