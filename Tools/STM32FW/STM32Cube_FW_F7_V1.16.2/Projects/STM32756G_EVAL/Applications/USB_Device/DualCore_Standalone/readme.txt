@par Application Description 

This application is a part of the USB Device Library package using STM32Cube firmware. It describes how to use
USB device application based on the STM32F7x6 multi core support feature integrating the Device Communication 
Class (CDC) and Human Interface (HID) in the same project.

This is a typical application on how to use the STM32F7x6 USB OTG Device peripheral, where STM32 is 
enumerated as a CDC device in the High Speed mode, and also as a HID device in the Full Speed mode,
using the native PC Host HID/CDC drivers to which the STM327x6G-EVAL board is connected.

At the beginning of the main program the HAL_Init() function is called to reset all the peripherals,
initialize the Flash interface and the systick. The user is provided with the SystemClock_Config()
function to configure the system clock (SYSCLK) to run at 216 MHz. The Full Speed (FS) USB module uses
internally a 48-MHz clock which is coming from a specific output of two PLLs: main PLL or PLL SAI.
In the High Speed (HS) mode the USB clock (60 MHz) is driven by the ULPI.

When the application is started, the user has just to plug the two USB cables into a PC host and two
USB devices (CDC/HID) are automatically detected. A new VCP drive appears in the system window
for the CDC device and serial communication operations can be performed as with any other serial
communication drive. A new HID Mouse device is detected, and the Joystick buttons mounted on 
the STM327x6G_EVAL board, allow to user to emulate the Mouse directions.

@note Care must be taken when using HAL_Delay(), this function provides accurate delay (in milliseconds)
      based on variable incremented in SysTick ISR. This implies that if HAL_Delay() is called from
      a peripheral ISR process, then the SysTick interrupt must have higher priority (numerically lower)
      than the peripheral interrupt. Otherwise the caller ISR process will be blocked.
      To change the SysTick interrupt priority you have to use HAL_NVIC_SetPriority() function.
      
@note The application needs to ensure that the SysTick time base is always set to 1 millisecond
      to have correct HAL operation.

@Note If the user code size exceeds the DTCM-RAM size or starts from internal cacheable memories (SRAM1 and SRAM2),that is shared between several processors,
      then it is highly recommended to enable the CPU cache and maintain its coherence at application level.
      The address and the size of cacheable buffers (shared between CPU and other masters)  must be properly updated to be aligned to cache line size (32 bytes).

@Note It is recommended to enable the cache and maintain its coherence, but depending on the use case
      It is also possible to configure the MPU as "Write through", to guarantee the write access coherence.
      In that case, the MPU must be configured as Cacheable/Bufferable/Not Shareable.
      Even though the user must manage the cache coherence for read accesses.
      Please refer to the AN4838 “Managing memory protection unit (MPU) in STM32 MCUs”
      Please refer to the AN4839 “Level 1 cache on STM32F7 Series”

@par Hardware and Software environment

  - This application runs on STM32F756xx/STM32F746xx devices.
    
  - This application has been tested with STMicroelectronics STM327x6G-EVAL RevB
    evaluation boards and can be easily tailored to any other supported device 
    and development board.

  - STM327x6G-EVAL RevB Set-up
    - Connect the STM327x6G-EVAL board to the PC through two 'USB micro A-Male 
      to A-Male' cables to the connectors:
      - CN8 : to use USB High Speed (HS) 
      - CN13: to use USB Full Speed (FS)            

@par How to use it ?

In order to make the program work, you must do the following :
 - Open your preferred toolchain 
 - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory
 - Run the application
