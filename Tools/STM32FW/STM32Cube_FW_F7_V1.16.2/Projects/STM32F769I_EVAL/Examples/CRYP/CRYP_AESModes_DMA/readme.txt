@par Example Description 


How to use the CRYPTO peripheral to encrypt/decrypt data(Plaintext/Ciphertext) using AES
ECB algorithm  in DMA mode with swapping.

At the beginning of the main program the HAL_Init() function is called to reset 
all the peripherals, initialize the Flash interface and the systick.
The SystemClock_Config() function is used to configure the system clock for STM32F777xx/STM32F779xx Devices :
The CPU at 216MHz 


The AES ECB requires:
1. Plaintext     : which will be encrypted with ECB algorithm & 128bits key.    
   Ciphertext    : which will be decrypted with ECB algorithm & 128bits key.
   Data Byte swapping (DataType 8):
   Plaintext_8   : which will be encrypted with ECB algorithm & 128bits key.    
   Ciphertext_8  : which will be decrypted with ECB algorithm & 128bits key.  
   Data half-word swapping (DataType 16):
   Plaintext_16  : which will be encrypted with ECB algorithm & 128bits key.    
   Ciphertext_16 : which will be decrypted with ECB algorithm & 128bits key.
   Data bit swapping (DataType 1):
   Plaintext_1   : which will be encrypted with ECB algorithm & 128bits key.    
   Ciphertext_1  : which will be decrypted with ECB algorithm & 128bits key.
   
2. Key: is the parameter which determines the Ciphertext. In this example 128 bits
   key is used

CRYP peripheral must be initialized once from the beginning, then for each 
operation of encryption/decryption, only configuration should be made if needed.
 
The AES-ECB encryption/decryption in DMA mode provide :
   Encryptedtext: which is the encryption result of Plaintext, it is compared
   to Ciphertext.
   Decryptedtext: which is the Decryption result of Ciphertext,it is compared
   to Plaintext.
1. No swapping, Encryptedtext compared to Ciphertext. then Decryptedtext compared to Plaintext.
2. Byte swapping, Encryptedtext compared to Ciphertext_8. then Decryptedtext compared to Plaintext_8.
3. half-word swapping, Encryptedtext compared to Ciphertext_16. then Decryptedtext compared to Plaintext_16.
4. Bit swapping, Encryptedtext compared to Ciphertext_1. then Decryptedtext compared to Plaintext_1.

STM32F779I_EVAL LEDs are used to monitor the encryption/decryption status:
 - LED1(GREEN) is ON when encryption/decryption and TAG generation is right.
 - LED3(RED) is ON when encryption or decryption or TAG generation is wrong.
      
@note The application needs to ensure that the SysTick time base is always set to 1 millisecond
      to have correct HAL operation.

@Note�If the user code size exceeds the DTCM-RAM size or starts from internal cacheable memories (SRAM1 and SRAM2),that is shared between several processors,
 �����then it is highly recommended to enable the CPU cache and maintain its coherence at application level.
������The address and the size of cacheable buffers (shared between CPU and other masters)  must be properly updated to be aligned to cache line size (32 bytes).

@Note It is recommended to enable the cache and maintain its coherence, but depending on the use case
����� It is also possible to configure the MPU as "Write through", to guarantee the write access coherence.
����������� � In that case, the MPU must be configured as Cacheable/Bufferable/Not Shareable.
����������� � Even though the user must manage the cache coherence for read accesses.
��������������Please refer to the AN4838 �Managing memory protection unit (MPU) in STM32 MCUs�
��������������Please refer to the AN4839 �Level 1 cache on STM32F7 Series�

@par Hardware and Software environment

  - This example runs on STM32F777xx/STM32F779xx devices.
  
  - This example has been tested with an STMicroelectronics STM32F779I_EVAL board revB
    board and can be easily tailored to any other supported device 
    and development board.

@par How to use it ? 

In order to make the program work, you must do the following:
 - Open your preferred toolchain 
 - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory
 - Run the example
