@par Example Description 

How to use the ADC in interrupt mode to convert data through the HAL API.

The ADC3 is configured to convert continuously ADC_CHANNEL_8.

Each time an end of conversion occurs an interrupt is generated and the converted 
data of ADC3 DR register is affected to the uhADCxConvertedValue variable in the 
ADC conversion complete call back function.


In this example, the system clock is 216MHz, APB2 = 108MHz and ADC clock = APB2/4. 
Since ADC3 clock is 27 MHz and sampling time is set to 3 cycles, the conversion 
time to 12bit data is 12 cycles so the total conversion time is (12+3)/27= 0.55us(1.8Msps).


User can vary the ADC_CHANNEL_8 voltage using the Eval Board potentiometer (RV1)
connected to PF.10 pin ADC_RegularConversion_Interrupt (e.g. using function generator).

@Note If the user code size exceeds the DTCM-RAM size or starts from internal cacheable memories (SRAM1 and SRAM2),that is shared between several processors,
      then it is highly recommended to enable the CPU cache and maintain its coherence at application level.
      The address and the size of cacheable buffers (shared between CPU and other masters)  must be properly updated to be aligned to cache line size (32 bytes).

@Note It is recommended to enable the cache and maintain its coherence, but depending on the use case
      It is also possible to configure the MPU as "Write through", to guarantee the write access coherence.
      In that case, the MPU must be configured as Cacheable/Bufferable/Not Shareable.
      Even though the user must manage the cache coherence for read accesses.
      Please refer to the AN4838 “Managing memory protection unit (MPU) in STM32 MCUs”
      Please refer to the AN4839 “Level 1 cache on STM32F7 Series”

@par Hardware and Software environment 

  - This example runs on STM32F767xx/STM32F769xx/STM32F777xx/STM32F779xx devices.
  
  - This example has been tested with STM32F769I-EVAL board and can be
    easily tailored to any other supported device and development board.

@par How to use it ? 

In order to make the program work, you must do the following :
 - Open your preferred toolchain 
 - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory
 - Run the example
