@par Application Description 


This application guides STM32Cube HAL API STM32Cube firmware with LwIP, LibJPEG and FreeRTOS middleware components 
to run a streaming server based on Netconn API of LwIP TCP/IP stack.

This application aims to encode the stream video RGB888 received from the camera
to JPEG format using LibJPEG. Then, the JPEG frames are sent through Ethernet peripheral
using the RTP protocol (Real-time Transport Protocol) to a remote client for example 
VLC media player. The RTSP protocol (Real Time Streaming Protocol) is used to control 
media sessions (SETUP, PLAY, TEARDOWN).

To understand messages received from the remote media player, this application implements
the RTSP server protocol. Also, it implements the RTP protocol for sending the MJEPG frames
to the media player.

To run this application, you need to:
    -Type the URL (rtsp://192.168.0.10) on the VLC media player (Media/Open Network Stream/Open Media window) 
    -It is recommended that the caching value is set to 100ms on the VLC to keep the stream running smoothly
     (Media/Open Network Stream/Open Media window => Show more options), then press Play on VLC Play button. 

The following libraries are used in the application:
	-LwIP stack: TCP/IP protocols stack
	-LibJPEG:    JPEG encoding/decoding library
	-FreeRTOS:   Real Time Operating System
        
If the LCD is used (#define USE_LCD in main.h), log messages will be displayed 
to inform user about camera initialization and ethernet cable status and the IP address value, else this 
will be ensured by LEDs:
  + LED1: ethernet cable is connected.
  + LED3: ethernet cable is not connected.

Note: In this application the Ethernet Link ISR need the System tick interrupt 
to configure the Ethernet MAC, so the Ethernet Link interrupt priority must be 
set lower (numerically greater) than the Systick interrupt priority to ensure 
that the System tick increments while executing the Ethernet Link ISR.

Note: By default, the Ethernet Half duplex mode is not supported in the 
STM32F769I-EVAL board, for more information refer to the HAL_ETH_MspInit() 
function in the ethernetif.c file.

@note Care must be taken when using HAL_Delay(), this function provides accurate delay (in milliseconds)
      based on variable incremented in SysTick ISR. This implies that if HAL_Delay() is called from
      a peripheral ISR process, then the SysTick interrupt must have higher priority (numerically lower)
      than the peripheral interrupt. Otherwise the caller ISR process will be blocked.
      To change the SysTick interrupt priority you have to use HAL_NVIC_SetPriority() function.
      
@note The application needs to ensure that the SysTick time base is always set to 1 millisecond
      to have correct HAL operation.
      
@note The STM32F7xx devices can reach a maximum clock frequency of 216MHz but as this application uses SDRAM,
      the system clock is limited to 200MHz. Indeed proper functioning of the SDRAM is only guaranteed 
      at a maximum system clock frequency of 200MHz.
