@par Application Description 

This application shows how to emulate EEPROM on internal flash.

Please refer to AN3969 for futher details regarding this application.

NUCLEO-F722ZE board LEDs can be used to monitor the application status:
  - LED2 is On when the application runs successfully.
  - LED2 is toggle in case of error.
 
@note Care must be taken when using HAL_Delay(), this function provides accurate delay (in milliseconds)
      based on variable incremented in SysTick ISR. This implies that if HAL_Delay() is called from
      a peripheral ISR process, then the SysTick interrupt must have higher priority (numerically lower)
      than the peripheral interrupt. Otherwise the caller ISR process will be blocked.
      To change the SysTick interrupt priority you have to use HAL_NVIC_SetPriority() function.
      
@note The application needs to ensure that the SysTick time base is always set to 1 millisecond
      to have correct HAL operation.
      
@note Before using the application, ensure that dedicated sectors for EEPROM are erased
      to avoid a match with a valid page OPCODE.

@par Keywords

EEPROM, Emulation, Flash, Program, Erase, Sectors, OPCODE

@Note If the user code size exceeds the DTCM-RAM size or starts from internal cacheable memories (SRAM1 and SRAM2),that is shared between several processors,
      then it is highly recommended to enable the CPU cache and maintain its coherence at application level.
      The address and the size of cacheable buffers (shared between CPU and other masters)  must be properly updated to be aligned to cache line size (32 bytes).

@Note It is recommended to enable the cache and maintain its coherence, but depending on the use case
      It is also possible to configure the MPU as "Write through", to guarantee the write access coherence.
      In that case, the MPU must be configured as Cacheable/Bufferable/Not Shareable.
      Even though the user must manage the cache coherence for read accesses.
      Please refer to the AN4838 “Managing memory protection unit (MPU) in STM32 MCUs”
      Please refer to the AN4839 “Level 1 cache on STM32F7 Series”

@par Hardware and Software environment

  - This application runs on STM32F722ZE devices.
    
  - This application has been tested with NUCLEO-F722ZE board and can be
    easily tailored to any other supported device and development board.

@note
Before using the application, ensure that dedicated sectors for EEPROM (FLASH_SECTOR_2 and FLASH_SECTOR_3) 
are erased to avoid a match with a valid page OPCODE.
