@par Example Description

This directory contains a set of source files and pre-configured projects that
describes how to build an application for execution from external memory using
the ExtMem_Boot firmware.

@note You must not touch any part of the system that has been initialized by the
      ExtMem_Boot firmware to avoid system failure, more details in the AN5188.

The STM32F730xx and STM32F750xx value line come with only 64KB internal flash.
These value line are intended for code execution from external memories.
This example shows how to boot from internal flash, configure external memories
then jump to user application located on external memory.
on The STM32F7308-DISCO, user can select QSPI flash for code execution.

Defines "CODE_AREA" , "DATA_AREA" and "BINARY_AREA" in file memory.h are used respectively
to select the Code execution area, the application data area and the binary storage area.
The ExtMem_Boot program is located at 0x08000000 (Internal flash).

Please Refer to the bellow "Table 1. IAP implementation on STM32F7308-DISCO" for different configurations and corresponding settings.

@par Keywords

Middleware, External Memory Execution, Loader, Boot

@Note If the user code size exceeds the DTCM-RAM size or starts from internal cacheable memories (SRAM1 and SRAM2),that is shared between several processors,
      then it is highly recommended to enable the CPU cache and maintain its coherence at application level.
      In case of constraints it is possible to configure the MPU as "Write through/not shareable" to guarantee the cache coherence at write access but the user
      has to ensure the cache maintenance at read access though.
      The address and the size of cacheable buffers (shared between CPU and other masters)  must be properly updated to be aligned to cache line size (32 bytes).

@Note It is recommended to enable the cache and maintain its coherence, but depending on the use case
      It is also possible to configure the MPU as "Write through", to guarantee the write access coherence.
      In that case, the MPU must be configured as Cacheable/Bufferable/Not Shareable.
      Even though the user must manage the cache coherence for read accesses.
      Please refer to the AN4838 (Managing memory protection unit (MPU) in STM32 MCUs)
      Please refer to the AN4839 (Level 1 cache on STM32F7 Series)

@par Hardware and Software environment

  - This example runs on STM32F730xx devices.

  - This example has been tested with STM32F7308-Discovery and can be
    easily tailored to any other supported device and development board.

Following configuration are supported by this boot firmware, Please refer to fmc.c, qspi.c
for exact memories part number:
  - XiP (Execute In Place):
      External Flash is configured and set to memory mapped mode.
      Set the Main Stack Pointer and then jump to application entry point.
        - QSPI : @ 0x90000000
            CODE_AREA   USE_QSPI

  - Volatile Memory :
      Memory Configuration (memory mapped mode)
        - Internal SRAM  : @ 0x20000000

@Note Configuration used in ExtMem_Boot and ExtMem_Application must be inline otherwise required resources
      will not be initialized as required.


@par How to use it?

In order to make the program work, you must do the following:

  1. Select required configuration in memory.h.
     The default configuration is: 
     - DATA_AREA set to USE_INTERNAL_SRAM
     - CODE_AREA set to USE_QSPI
  2. Program the internal Flash with the ExtMem_Boot (see below).
  4. Program the external memory with your application (see below).
  5. Start debugging user application or reset for free running.

In order to load the ExtMem_Boot code :
   - Open your preferred toolchain :
      - Open the Project
      - Rebuild all files
      - Load project image

In order to load the user application to the external memory:
   - Open your preferred toolchain
      - Open the Project
      - Use project matching ExtMem_Boot selected configuration
      - Rebuild all files:
      - Run & debug the program:
      - For an XiP configuration (eXecute in Place from QSPI):
          - Using EWARM or MDK-ARM : Load project image from the IDE: Project->Debug
          - Using SW4STM32 :
            - Open the STM32CubeProgrammer tool
            - Select the QSPI external flash loader "MX25L512G_STM32F7308-DISCO"
            - From Erasing & Programming menu, browse and open the output binary file relative to your application
            - Load the file into the external QSPI flash using "Start Programming" at the address APPLICATION_ADDRESS (0x90000000)
