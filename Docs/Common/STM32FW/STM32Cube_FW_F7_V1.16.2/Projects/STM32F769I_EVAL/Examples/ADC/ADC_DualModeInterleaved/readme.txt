@par Example Description 

How to use two ADC peripherals to perform conversions in dual interleaved mode.

The ADC1 and ADC2 are configured to convert ADC_CHANNEL_12, with conversion 
triggered by software.

The Dual interleaved delay is configured to 6 ADC clk cycles (ADC_TWOSAMPLINGDELAY_6CYCLES).

On each DMA request (two data items are available) two bytes representing two 
ADC-converted data items are transferred as a half word to uhADCDualConvertedValue variable.

A DMA request is generated each time 2 data items are available
1st request: ADC_CDR[15:0] = (ADC2_DR[7:0] << 8) | ADC1_DR[7:0] 
2nd request: ADC_CDR[15:0] = (ADC2_DR[7:0] << 8) | ADC1_DR[7:0]

The DMA mode 3 is used in interleaved mode in 6-bit and 8-bit resolutions.

In this example, the system clock is 216MHz, APB2 = 108MHz and ADC clock = APB2/4. 
Since ADCCLK = 27 MHz and Conversion rate = 6 cycles
==> Conversion Time = 27M/6cyc = 4.5Msps.

The ADC measure is realized on PC.02, so you need to connect this pin to a power supply (do not forget to connect the power supply 
GND to the EVAL board GND).

STM32 board's LEDs can be used to monitor the transfer status:
 - LED1 is ON when the conversion is complete.
 - LED3 is ON when there are an error in initialization. 
  
@note Refer to "simulation.xls" file to have the diagram simulation of the example.

@note Care must be taken when using HAL_Delay(), this function provides accurate delay (in milliseconds)
      based on variable incremented in SysTick ISR. This implies that if HAL_Delay() is called from
      a peripheral ISR process, then the SysTick interrupt must have higher priority (numerically lower)
      than the peripheral interrupt. Otherwise the caller ISR process will be blocked.
      To change the SysTick interrupt priority you have to use HAL_NVIC_SetPriority() function.
      
@note The application need to ensure that the SysTick time base is always set to 1 millisecond
      to have correct HAL operation.

@Note If the user code size exceeds the DTCM-RAM size or starts from internal cacheable memories (SRAM1 and SRAM2),that is shared between several processors,
      then it is highly recommended to enable the CPU cache and maintain its coherence at application level.
      The address and the size of cacheable buffers (shared between CPU and other masters)  must be properly updated to be aligned to cache line size (32 bytes).

@Note It is recommended to enable the cache and maintain its coherence, but depending on the use case
      It is also possible to configure the MPU as "Write through", to guarantee the write access coherence.
      In that case, the MPU must be configured as Cacheable/Bufferable/Not Shareable.
      Even though the user must manage the cache coherence for read accesses.
      Please refer to the AN4838 “Managing memory protection unit (MPU) in STM32 MCUs”
      Please refer to the AN4839 “Level 1 cache on STM32F7 Series”

@par Hardware and Software environment 

  - This example runs on STM32F767xx/STM32F769xx/STM32F777xx/STM32F779xx devices.

  - This example has been tested with STM32769I-EVAL evaluation board and can be
    easily tailored to any other supported device and development board.

@par How to use it ? 

In order to make the program work, you must do the following :
 - Open your preferred toolchain 
 - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory
 - Run the example
