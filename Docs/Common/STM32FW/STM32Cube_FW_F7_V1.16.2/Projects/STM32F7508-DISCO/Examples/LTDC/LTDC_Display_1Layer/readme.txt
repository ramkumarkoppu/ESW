@par Example Description

  How to configure the LTDC peripheral to display a 480x272 RGB888 (24 bits/pixel) 
  image on LCD using only one layer.

  In this example, the code is executed from QSPI external memory while data are in internal
  SRAM memory.

  At the beginning of the main program the HAL_Init() function is called to reset 
  all the peripherals, initialize the Flash interface and the systick.
  Then the SystemClock_Config() function is used to configure the system
  clock (SYSCLK) to run at 216 MHz.
 
  After LCD initialization, the LCD layer 1 is configured to display an image 
  (modelled by an array) loaded directly from flash memory by LTDC integrated DMA.

  Each LCD device has its specific synchronous timings values.
  This example uses AM480272H3TMQW-T01H LCD (MB1046 B-01) and configures 
  the synchronous timings as following :

  Horizontal Synchronization (Hsync) = 41
  Horizontal Back Porch (HBP)        = 13
  Active Width                       = 480
  Horizontal Front Porch (HFP)       = 32

  Vertical Synchronization (Vsync)   = 10
  Vertical Back Porch (VBP)          = 2
  Active Heigh                       = 272
  Vertical Front Porch (VFP)         = 2
  
  LCD_TFT windowing configuration :
  ---------------------------------

  To configure the active display window, this example configures the 
  horizontal/vertical start and stop. 

  HorizontalStart = (Offset_X + Hsync + HBP);
  HorizontalStop  = (Offset_X + Hsync + HBP + Window_Width - 1); 
  VarticalStart   = (Offset_Y + Vsync + VBP);
  VerticalStop    = (Offset_Y + Vsync + VBP + Window_Heigh - 1);
  
  Window_width and Window_heigh should be in line with the image size to be 
  displayed.

STM32 Discovery board's LED can be used to monitor the transfer status:
 - LED1 is ON when there is an error in Init process.

@note Care must be taken when using HAL_Delay(), this function provides accurate delay (in milliseconds)
      based on variable incremented in SysTick ISR. This implies that if HAL_Delay() is called from
      a peripheral ISR process, then the SysTick interrupt must have higher priority (numerically lower)
      than the peripheral interrupt. Otherwise the caller ISR process will be blocked.
      To change the SysTick interrupt priority you have to use HAL_NVIC_SetPriority() function.
      
@note The application needs to ensure that the SysTick time base is always set to 1 millisecond
      to have correct HAL operation.

@Note If the user code size exceeds the DTCM-RAM size or starts from internal cacheable memories (SRAM1 and SRAM2),that is shared between several processors,
      then it is highly recommended to enable the CPU cache and maintain its coherence at application level.
      The address and the size of cacheable buffers (shared between CPU and other masters)  must be properly updated to be aligned to cache line size (32 bytes).

@Note It is recommended to enable the cache and maintain its coherence, but depending on the use case
      It is also possible to configure the MPU as "Write through", to guarantee the write access coherence.
      In that case, the MPU must be configured as Cacheable/Bufferable/Not Shareable.
      Even though the user must manage the cache coherence for read accesses.
      Please refer to the AN4838 “Managing memory protection unit (MPU) in STM32 MCUs”
      Please refer to the AN4839 “Level 1 cache on STM32F7 Series”

 - Run & debug the program:
   - Using EWARM or MDK-ARM : Load project image from the IDE: Project->Debug
   - Using SW4STM32 :
       - Open the STM32CubeProgrammer tool
       - Select the QSPI external flash loader "N25Q128A_STM32F7508-DISCO"
